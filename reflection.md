## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Throughout this assignment, I gained valuable insights into the importance of balancing AI assistance with personal coding skills. While tools like GitHub Copilot can be helpful for small code segments, I learned that relying solely on AI for complex problems is insufficient. This experience reinforced the necessity of developing strong fundamental coding skills.

One of the main challenges I faced was achieving the required code similarity, especially for the 'program.py' file. I realized that there are indeed many ways to solve a programming problem, which can lead to variations in code structure. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the problem thoroughly and considering multiple approaches before settling on a solution.

The process of comparing my code with the expected output was particularly enlightening. By examining the differences, I was able to identify areas for improvement more effectively. This approach not only helped me correct errors but also deepened my understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

I found it interesting that while AI tools like Copilot could suggest partial solutions, they couldn't fully resolve all issues. This reinforced the importance of human oversight and problem-solving skills in programming. It became clear that AI tools are best used as aids to augment human intelligence rather than replace it entirely.

Moving forward, I plan to:

Focus on improving my problem-solving skills to approach coding tasks from multiple angles.
Use AI tools judiciously, combining their suggestions with my own understanding and logic.
Pay more attention to code structure and style to improve similarity with expected solutions while maintaining functionality.
Engage more deeply with the assignment requirements to ensure all criteria are met, including proper reflection.
This assignment has been a valuable learning experience, highlighting the balance between leveraging AI assistance and developing personal coding expertise. It has motivated me to continue refining my skills and approach to problem-solving in programming.
